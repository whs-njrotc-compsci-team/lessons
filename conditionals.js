/*  ====================
 *  CONDITIONALS LESSON
 *  ====================
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *  In programming, conditionals are used to make decisions.
 *  a conditional would have a condition which will be a
 *  boolean. Depending on the value of the boolean, the
 *  condtional may execute code in it's body.
 *
 *  Take a look!

// The condtion is true
if (true) {
    // This code will run!
} else {
    // This code will not run but is here just in case
    // the conditon is false.
}

// The condtion is false
if (false) {
    // This code will not run but is here just in case
    // the conditon is true.
} else {
    // This code will run!
}

// More than on condtion
if (false) {
    // This code will not run but is here just in case
    // this conditon is true.
} else if (false) {
    // This code will not run but is here just in case
    // this conditon is true.
} else if (true) {
    // This code will run!
} else {
    // This code will not run but is here just in case
    // all conditons are false.
